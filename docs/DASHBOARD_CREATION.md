# AI Agent Dashboard Creation

This document explains how to use the AI Agent to create and manage Home Assistant dashboards.

## Overview

The AI Agent HA integration now supports creating and managing Home Assistant dashboards through natural language conversations. The AI can:

- Create new dashboards based on your requirements
- Update existing dashboards
- Query available entities and organize them into logical dashboard layouts
- Ask follow-up questions to clarify your dashboard requirements
- Suggest appropriate card types and layouts

## How It Works

The AI Agent uses the following workflow for dashboard creation:

1. **Requirement Gathering**: When you ask to create a dashboard, the AI will gather information about your needs
2. **Entity Analysis**: The AI queries your Home Assistant instance to understand available entities
3. **Dashboard Design**: Based on your requirements and available entities, the AI creates a dashboard configuration
4. **Implementation**: The AI creates the dashboard files and updates your Home Assistant configuration
5. **Follow-up**: The AI can make adjustments or answer questions about the created dashboard

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Simple Dashboard

```
"Create a dashboard for my living room lights"
```

The AI will:
- Query your light entities
- Filter for living room lights
- Create a dashboard with appropriate light control cards
- Set up the dashboard with a logical layout

### Creating a Comprehensive Dashboard

```
"Create a security dashboard that shows all my door sensors, cameras, and alarm controls"
```

The AI will:
- Query for security-related entities (binary sensors, cameras, alarm panels)
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Create a multi-view dashboard with:
  - Sensor overview
  - Camera feeds
  - Alarm control panel
  - Recent security events

### Creating a Room-Specific Dashboard

```
"I want a kitchen dashboard with lights, temperature sensor, and appliance controls"
```

The AI will:
- Find entities related to the kitchen area
- Create appropriate cards for each entity type
- Organize them in a logical layout
- Include relevant controls and status displays

## Dashboard Features

### Supported Card Types

The AI can create dashboards using these Home Assistant card types:

- **Entities Card**: List of entities with states and controls
- **Glance Card**: Compact grid view of entity states
- **Thermostat Card**: Climate control interface
- **Weather Forecast Card**: Weather information display
- **Media Control Card**: Media player controls
- **Light Card**: Dedicated light controls
- **Alarm Panel Card**: Security system interface
- **Picture Entity Card**: Entity with background image
- **History Graph Card**: Historical data visualization
- **Gauge Card**: Single value displays

### Dashboard Organization

Dashboards are automatically organized by:

- **Entity Domain**: Lights, sensors, switches grouped logically
- **Room/Area**: Entities grouped by location when detected
- **Functionality**: Related controls grouped together
- **Priority**: Most important controls placed prominently

## AI Interaction Flow

### Initial Request
```
User: "Create a dashboard for energy monitoring"
```

### AI Information Gathering
```
AI: "I'll create an energy monitoring dashboard for you. Let me first check what energy-related entities you have available."

[AI queries power sensors, energy meters, solar panels, etc.]

AI: "I found several energy entities. Would you like to include:
- Real-time power consumption
- Daily energy usage graphs
- Solar production (if applicable)
- Individual device monitoring
- Cost tracking

What would you like to focus on?"
```

### User Clarification
```
User: "I want to see real-time power usage and daily graphs for the main house consumption"
```

### AI Dashboard Creation
```
AI: "Perfect! I'll create an energy dashboard with:
- Current power consumption gauge
- Daily energy usage graph
- Monthly cost tracking
- Top energy consumers

Creating the dashboard now..."

[AI creates the dashboard]

AI: "Energy dashboard created successfully! You can find it in your sidebar as 'Energy Monitoring'. The dashboard includes real-time power monitoring and historical usage graphs. Would you like me to add any other energy-related information?"
```

## Advanced Features

### Follow-up Questions

The AI will ask clarifying questions when:
- Multiple entities match your criteria
- Your request is ambiguous
- Better organization options are available
- Additional relevant entities are found

Example:
```
User: "Create a lights dashboard"
AI: "I found lights in multiple rooms. Would you like:
1. All lights in one dashboard
2. Separate views for each room
3. Group by light type (overhead, lamps, accent)
4. Focus on specific rooms

Also, I noticed you have some smart switches controlling lights - should I include those as well?"
```

### Template-Based Creation

The AI uses intelligent templates for common dashboard types:
- Security monitoring
- Climate control
- Media centers
- Energy monitoring
- Room-specific controls

### Dynamic Entity Discovery

The AI automatically:
- Discovers related entities
- Suggests relevant additions
- Organizes by areas/rooms when possible
- Filters out irrelevant entities

## Technical Details

### Dashboard Configuration

Created dashboards include:
- **Title and URL**: Descriptive names and clean URLs
- **Icons**: Appropriate Material Design icons
- **Sidebar Integration**: Automatic sidebar placement
- **View Organization**: Logical view structure
- **Card Layout**: Optimized card arrangements

### File Management

The AI creates:
- Dashboard YAML files in `/config/dashboards/`
- Updates to `configuration.yaml` if needed
- Proper dashboard registration

### Error Handling

The system handles:
- Missing entities gracefully
- Invalid configurations
- Permission issues
- File system errors

## Service Calls

### Available Services

The integration provides these services:

#### `glm_agent_ha.query`
Natural language dashboard requests through the main query interface.

```yaml
service: glm_agent_ha.query
data:
  prompt: "Create a living room dashboard"
  provider: "openai"  # optional
```

#### `glm_agent_ha.create_dashboard`
Direct dashboard creation (for advanced users).

```yaml
service: glm_agent_ha.create_dashboard
data:
  dashboard_config:
    title: "My Dashboard"
    url_path: "my-dashboard"
    views:
      - title: "Overview"
        cards:
          - type: "entities"
            entities: ["light.living_room"]
```

#### `glm_agent_ha.update_dashboard`

```

## Best Practices

### Clear Requirements
Be specific about what you want:
- "Kitchen lights and appliances" vs "Kitchen stuff"
- "Security cameras and door sensors" vs "Security things"

### Room Organization
Mention specific rooms or areas:
- "Living room entertainment center"
- "Bedroom climate control"
- "Garage workshop controls"

### Functionality Focus
Specify the main purpose:
- "Morning routine dashboard"
- "Evening security check"
- "Energy optimization center"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard Not Appearing**
   - Check if Home Assistant restart is required
   - Verify dashboard was created in configuration
   - Check for configuration errors in logs

2. **Missing Entities**
   - Ensure entities exist and are enabled
   - Check entity naming and availability
   - Verify permissions and access rights

3. **Layout Issues**
   - Ask AI to reorganize the dashboard
   - Request specific card types
   - Modify through standard HA dashboard editor

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Home Assistant logs for errors
2. Ask the AI to troubleshoot: "Check my energy dashboard creation"
3. Use the AI to modify or recreate dashboards
4. Report issues with specific error messages

## Future Enhancements
