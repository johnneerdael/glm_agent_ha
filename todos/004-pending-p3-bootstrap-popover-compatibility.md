# Bootstrap Popover API Compatibility Issue

## Problem Statement
Bootstrap-autofill-overlay is trying to use the Popover API which is not supported in the user's browser, causing JavaScript errors.

## Findings
- Location: bootstrap-autofill-overlay.js:3087
- Error: NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'showPopover' on 'HTMLElement'
- Browser doesn't support popover API on target elements
- JavaScript error thrown but doesn't break core functionality
- Autofill overlay may not work properly

### Scenario Details
1. Bootstrap library tries to show popover using showPopover API
2. Browser doesn't support popover API on the target element
3. NotSupportedError is thrown at AutofillInlineMenuContentService
4. Error propagates through Generator.next and fulfilled handlers
5. Autofill overlay functionality may be impaired

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Add Feature Detection and Fallback
- **Pros**: Maintains compatibility across browsers, graceful degradation
- **Cons**: Requires additional code complexity
- **Effort**: Small
- **Risk**: Low

### Option 2: Replace Bootstrap-autofill-overlay Dependency
- **Pros**: More reliable solution, eliminates compatibility issues
- **Cons**: May require finding alternative library
- **Effort**: Small
- **Risk**: Low

## Recommended Action
Add feature detection and fallback for browsers that don't support the Popover API, or replace the bootstrap-autofill-overlay dependency with a more compatible solution.

## Technical Details
- **Affected Files**: bootstrap-autofill-overlay.js (external dependency)
- **Related Components**: Autofill functionality, form interactions
- **Database Changes**: No

## Resources
- Original finding: Frontend browser console errors
- Related issues: Frontend functionality issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Popover API feature detection implemented
- [ ] Fallback mechanism for unsupported browsers
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] Autofill functionality works across browsers
- [ ] Code reviewed

## Work Log

### 2025-10-18 - Initial Discovery
**By:** Claude Triage System
**Actions:**
- Issue discovered during frontend triage session
- Categorized as P3 (Nice-to-have)
- Root cause identified as API compatibility issue
- Estimated effort: Small (1-2 hours)

**Learnings:**
- New browser APIs may not be universally supported
- Feature detection is essential for compatibility
- Graceful degradation improves user experience

## Notes
Source: Triage session on 2025-10-18
Non-critical but affects autofill functionality in unsupported browsers
