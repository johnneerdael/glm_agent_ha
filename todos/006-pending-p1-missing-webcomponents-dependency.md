# Missing WebComponents Dependency

## Problem Statement
The frontend is trying to load a WebComponents scoped registry module that doesn't exist, causing 404 errors and potentially breaking component registration.

## Findings
- Location: unknown/node_modules/@webcomponents/scoped-custom-element-registry/src/scoped-custom-element-registry.ts:1
- Module returns 404 from unknown/node_modules path
- Component registration may be affected
- May be related to the connectedCallback failures
- Invalid path suggests incorrect module loading attempt

### Scenario Details
1. Frontend attempts to load scoped-custom-element-registry module
2. Module loading fails with 404 from unknown/node_modules path
3. Component registration process may be interrupted or incomplete
4. Related to connectedCallback failures in Issue #005
5. Invalid path indicates configuration or dependency management issue

### Root Cause Analysis
The path "unknown/node_modules/@webcomponents/scoped-custom-element-registry/src/scoped-custom-element-registry.ts" suggests:
- Module path is incorrectly configured
- Dependency may be specified in package.json but not actually installed
- Path resolution is failing due to missing or misconfigured dependency
- May be related to build process or bundling configuration issues

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Remove Invalid Dependency Reference
- **Pros**: Eliminates error, simplifies codebase
- **Cons**: May remove needed functionality if dependency was intended
- **Effort**: Small
- **Risk**: Low

### Option 2: Fix Module Path and Installation
- **Pros**: Maintains intended functionality, proper dependency management
- **Cons**: Requires understanding of intended usage
- **Effort**: Small
- **Risk**: Low

## Recommended Action
Remove dependency on the non-existent scoped-custom-element-registry module or replace it with a proper implementation. The path suggests it's trying to load from an incorrect location.

## Technical Details
- **Affected Files**: glm_agent_ha-panel.js (module imports), possibly package.json
- **Related Components**: Component registration system, WebComponents integration
- **Database Changes**: No

## Resources
- Original finding: Frontend browser console errors
- Related issues: Issue #005 - connectedCallback failures (likely related)
- Reference: WebComponents documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Invalid module reference removed or fixed
- [ ] No 404 errors for WebComponents dependencies
- [ ] Component registration works properly
- [ ] Frontend loads without dependency errors
- [ ] Code reviewed

## Work Log

### 2025-10-18 - Initial Discovery
**By:** Claude Triage System
**Actions:**
- Issue discovered during frontend triage session
- Categorized as P1 (Critical)
- Root cause identified as missing dependency
- Dependency on Issue #005 resolution identified
- Estimated effort: Small (1-2 hours)

**Learnings:**
- Missing dependencies can cascade to multiple component failures
- Proper dependency management is essential for frontend stability
- Module path resolution issues need careful configuration

## Notes
Source: Triage session on 2025-10-18
CRITICAL - May be blocking component registration and related to core frontend functionality
Dependent on Issue #005 resolution
