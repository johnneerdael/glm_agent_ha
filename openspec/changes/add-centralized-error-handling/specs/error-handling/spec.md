## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Centralized Error Collection
The system SHALL provide centralized error collection from all integration components.

#### Scenario: Error collection from MCP integration
- **WHEN** MCP integration encounters an error
- **THEN** the error is captured by the centralized error handler
- **AND** error includes component name, error type, timestamp, and context

#### Scenario: Error collection from AI task pipeline
- **WHEN** AI task pipeline fails to process a task
- **THEN** the error is logged centrally with task details
- **AND** error includes task ID, pipeline stage, and failure reason

### Requirement: Health Status Monitoring
The system SHALL monitor the health of critical integration subsystems.

#### Scenario: MCP connection health check
- **WHEN** periodic health check runs
- **THEN** MCP connection status is evaluated
- **AND** status is reported as HEALTHY, DEGRADED, or UNHEALTHY

#### Scenario: HTTP route health monitoring
- **WHEN** HTTP routes are checked
- **THEN** route registration status is validated
- **AND** failed routes trigger health status degradation

### Requirement: Error Recovery with Exponential Backoff
The system SHALL automatically attempt to recover from transient failures.

#### Scenario: MCP connection recovery
- **WHEN** MCP connection fails
- **THEN** system attempts reconnection with exponential backoff
- **AND** retry attempts are logged and monitored

#### Scenario: HTTP route registration recovery
- **WHEN** HTTP route registration fails
- **THEN** system retries registration with increasing delays
- **AND** maximum retry limits prevent infinite loops

### Requirement: Diagnostic Dashboard Integration
The system SHALL provide real-time error and health information to users.

#### Scenario: Real-time error streaming
- **WHEN** new errors occur in the system
- **THEN** errors are streamed to the frontend dashboard
- **AND** users can view errors filtered by category and time

#### Scenario: Health status visualization
- **WHEN** users access the diagnostic dashboard
- **THEN** overall system health is displayed
- **AND** individual component health status is shown

### Requirement: Error Analytics and Reporting
The system SHALL provide error analytics and export capabilities.

#### Scenario: Error trend analysis
- **WHEN** users request error analytics
- **THEN** error trends over time are calculated
- **AND** most common error types are identified

#### Scenario: Diagnostic export
- **WHEN** users need support assistance
- **THEN** diagnostic information can be exported
- **AND** export includes error logs, health status, and system configuration

### Requirement: Configurable Error Handling
The system SHALL provide configurable error handling preferences.

#### Scenario: Error notification configuration
- **WHEN** users configure error notifications
- **THEN** notification thresholds can be set per error category
- **AND** users can choose notification methods

#### Scenario: Error retention configuration
- **WHEN** administrators configure error retention
- **THEN** retention periods can be set per error severity
- **AND** automatic cleanup runs based on retention policies
