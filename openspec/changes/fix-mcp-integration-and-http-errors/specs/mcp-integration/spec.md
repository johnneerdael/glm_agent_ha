## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: MCP Server Connection Management
The integration SHALL establish and maintain connections to MCP servers with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.

#### Scenario: MCP server connection failure
- **WHEN** an MCP server returns HTTP status 400 or fails to connect after 3 attempts
- **THEN** the integration SHALL log the failure with specific error details
- **THEN** the integration SHALL continue operating without MCP-enhanced capabilities
- **THEN** the integration SHALL provide a degraded mode notification to users

#### Scenario: Native FastMCP integration
- **WHEN** MCP servers are configured with Python implementations
- **THEN** the integration SHALL use FastMCP for native Python execution instead of HTTP connections
- **THEN** the integration SHALL bypass Docker container limitations
- **THEN** the integration SHALL provide enhanced performance and reliability

#### Scenario: MCP server retry logic
- **WHEN** an MCP server connection fails
- **THEN** the integration SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
- **THEN** the integration SHALL limit retry attempts to prevent infinite loops
- **THEN** the integration SHALL provide clear error messaging in the logs

#### Scenario: MCP capability degradation
- **WHEN** MCP connections are unavailable
- **THEN** the integration SHALL maintain core functionality without enhanced features
- **THEN** the integration SHALL clearly indicate which features are unavailable
- **THEN** the integration SHALL automatically restore MCP features when connections recover
