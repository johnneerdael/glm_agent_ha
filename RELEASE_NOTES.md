# GLM Agent HA v1.03.0 Release Notes

## üéâ Major New Feature: AI Task Entity Integration

GLM Agent HA v1.03.0 introduces powerful integration with Home Assistant's native AI Task API, enabling sophisticated structured data generation with image/video analysis capabilities.

## üöÄ What's New

### AI Task Entity
- **Full Home Assistant AI Task API Integration**: Native support for structured data generation tasks
- **Image/Video Attachment Support**: Process camera snapshots and other media sources
- **Structured Output Generation**: Convert natural language to structured JSON data
- **MCP Vision Integration**: Leverage Model Context Protocol for advanced vision analysis (Pro/Max plans)

### MCP Vision Workaround
Since GLM models lack native vision capabilities, we've implemented an innovative solution:
1. **Media Download**: Downloads images/videos from `media-source://` URIs
2. **URL Generation**: Saves to HA's `www` folder and generates publicly accessible URLs
3. **MCP Analysis**: Z.AI MCP analyzes images via URL access
4. **Context Enhancement**: Combines MCP analysis with user instructions
5. **GLM Processing**: Processes enhanced context with structured output

### Configuration Options
- `enable_ai_task`: Enable/disable AI Task entity
- `ha_base_url`: Configurable base URL for image hosting (e.g., `https://ha.netskope.pro`)
- `enable_mcp_integration`: Toggle MCP features (for Pro/Max plans)

## üìã Example Use Cases

### Camera Analysis Automation
```yaml
actions:
  - alias: Analyze camera image
    action: ai_task.generate_data
    data:
      task_name: "camera_analysis"
      instructions: "Give a 1 sentence analysis of what is happening in this camera picture"
      structure:
        analysis:
          selector:
            text: null
      attachments:
        - media_content_id: media-source://camera.hallway
          media_content_type: ""
      entity_id: ai_task.glm_agent_ai_task
```

**Result**: `{"analysis": "A person wearing a blue jacket is walking through the hallway"}`

### Natural Language to Structured Data
```yaml
action: ai_task.generate_data
data:
  instructions: "Extract the room name and temperature from: 'Living room is currently 22¬∞C'"
  structure:
    room:
      selector:
        text: null
    temperature:
      selector:
        number:
          min: -50
          max: 50
  entity_id: ai_task.glm_agent_ai_task
```

**Result**: `{"room": "Living room", "temperature": 22}`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New Files Added
- `custom_components/glm_agent_ha/ai_task_entity.py` - Main AI Task entity implementation
- `custom_components/glm_agent_ha/ai_task/__init__.py` - AI Task platform setup
- `custom_components/glm_agent_ha/mcp_integration.py` - MCP server integration
- `tests/test_ai_agent_ha/test_ai_task_entity.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `docs/HA_AI_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed integration architecture
- `docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md` - MCP server documentation

### Key Features
- **Plan-Based Access**: MCP vision features available for Pro/Max plans
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when MCP services are unavailable
- **Security**: Proper validation of media sources and URLs
- **Performance**: Efficient media handling with unique filename generation

### Dependencies Updated
- Added `media_source` and `ai_task` Home Assistant dependencies
- Updated OpenAI requirement to `~=1.55.0` for newer features

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Media Processing Flow
```
1. AI Task receives media-source://camera/hallway
2. Resolves to actual camera snapshot URL
3. Downloads image bytes
4. Saves to www/ai_task_20251013_220000_abc123.jpg
5. Generates URL: https://ha.netskope.pro/local/ai_task_20251013_220000_abc123.jpg
6. Passes URL to Z.AI MCP for analysis
7. MCP extracts: "A person wearing a blue jacket is walking through the hallway"
8. Combines with instructions and processes with GLM
9. Returns structured: {"analysis": "A person in a blue jacket is walking through the hallway"}
```

### MCP Integration
- **Z.AI MCP Server**: Image/video analysis services
- **Web Search MCP**: Enhanced information retrieval
- **Plan Restrictions**: Lite plan uses text-only, Pro/Max plans enable vision

## üß™ Testing

- **334 lines of tests** for AI Task entity functionality
- **Test coverage**: Entity creation, media handling, MCP integration, error scenarios
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end AI Task workflows
- **Mock testing**: Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Media Source Validation**: Proper validation of `media-source://` URIs
- **URL Generation**: Safe filename generation with hash-based uniqueness
- **Access Control**: MCP integration respects Home Assistant permissions
- **Data Privacy**: Temporary files managed securely with optional cleanup

## üìö Documentation

- **User Guide**: Configuration and setup instructions
- **API Reference**: Detailed AI Task entity documentation
- **Integration Plan**: Complete architecture overview
- **MCP Documentation**: Server integration details

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

- Phase 3: LLM API tool integration
- Enhanced multi-modal capabilities
- Advanced automation scenarios

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Improved error handling for media source resolution
- Enhanced logging for debugging MCP integration
- Better compatibility with different Home Assistant versions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

None. This is a feature-only release with backward compatibility maintained.
